This repository contains the code associated with the paper "Maximum entropy networks applied on Twitter disinformation datasets".

To use the different scripts, you need to download the archives from the Twitter information operations. 

The different steps to undertake for each dataset are the following:
1. extract the external tweets that need to be downloaded
2. download the external tweets
3. build the interaction network(s)
4. identify the significant interactions and project the interaction network on the user layer
5. analyze the results

The scripts are written in Julia (>= 1.6) and Python (>=3.8).

## Obtaining external tweets

## Building the network

## Exporting the network to Gephi
